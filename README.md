# Getting Started

### Requirement:

You should have Node and NPM(or yarn) installed.

In the project directory, you can run:

### Run development

```bash
npm start  # or yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run test

```bash
npm test  # or yarn test
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build  # or yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Assumptions and concern
